# 👋 Hi there, I'm Son Truong!

I'm a **final-year Computer Engineering student** who loves building **smart, efficient AI systems**  
that make a difference in the real world.

My interests span across **Deep Learning**, **medical imaging**, and **embedded AI systems**.  
My current focus lies in applying **Deep Learning** and **Edge AI** methodologies  
to design efficient, reliable, and real-world applicable intelligent systems

Outside of coding, I’m a big fan of **books**, **coffee**, and the art of **management** —  
because great engineering is as much about people and ideas as it is about code.
